<!-- What is react  -->
 <!-- React is just a easier way of writting code of HTML/CSS/JS, that finally gets converted in to HTML CSS and JS, browswer does not understand  React the code finally gets converted to HTML CSS and JS-->

 <!-- // Why do you need React or any front end framework
  react has some libraries which make dom manipulation easier 
// react solves for dynamic websites, these libraries make DOM manipulation easier -->

<!-- require to write too much code  -->

<!-- Some react jargon  -->
<!-- three important things for react are, state and component and rerendering  -->
<!-- state: an object that represents the current state of the app, anything that will change that need to hold in state  -->
<!-- example, count for counter application  -->
<!-- for the linkedin Topbar it could be something like this-  state would be  {
{ topbar:{
home:0,
jobs:0,
messages:0,
notifications:0}
}}-->

<!-- components: it is an HTML template, it is a dynamic snippet -->

<!-- Re-rendering: state is change and the dom element value is changed it is called as a Re-render -->

<!-- You usually have to define all your components once and then all you have to do is update the state of your app, react takes care of re-rendering your app  -->
