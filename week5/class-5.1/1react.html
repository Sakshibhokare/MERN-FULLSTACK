<!-- // Why do you need React or any front end framework
// react solves for dynamic websites, these libraries make DOM manipulation easier -->
<!-- require to write too much code  -->

<!-- Some react jargon  -->
<!-- two important things for react are, state and component -->
<!-- state: an object that represents the current state of the app, anything that will change that need to hold in state  -->
<!-- example, count for counter application  -->
<!-- for the linkedin Topbar it could be something like this-  state would be  {
{ topbar:{
home:0,
jobs:0,
messages:0,
notifications:0}
}}-->

<!-- components: it is an HTML template, it is a dynamic snippet -->

<!-- Re-rendering: state is change and the dom element value is changed it is called as a Re-render -->

<!-- You usually have to define all your components once and then all you have to do is update the state of your app, react takes care of re-rendering your app  -->
