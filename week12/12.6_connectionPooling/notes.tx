why prisma do not work on serverless?
there can be many connection open to the database which are open
it could have 100s of workers running on diff location, this will hit the database limit 
this will hit the maximum connection limit to prevent this connection pooling has interduced 
there are many dependancis with node for prisma, ex engine this the reason why prisma do not work with cloud flare

connection pooling:instead of connecting all workers directly to the database
will create a connection pooling, a point where many connection will come
from this point will connect to the database 
so your database will get limited connection requests

worker1 worker2 ... workern-> Conn. pool -> database


you have to make some changes to let prisma work on cloud flare app
if you want to deploy prisma on cloudflare, prisma -> cloudflare -> connection pool -> database
will have to make some changes, below are the steps:
step1. initialize the cloudflare project: npm create cloudflare@latest
it will initialize the empty worker app 

step2. 
Set up prisma ORM: npm install --save-dev prisma
initialize prisma npx prisma init 

Step 3: update ur database schema 
npx prisma migrate dev --name init 

Step 4:this the way to use prisma orm on cloudflare 
Enable accelerate in the Prisma Data platform
to get started with prisma accelerate
1. sign up for a free prisma data platform account
2. create a project // it means we are creating workers 
3. Navigate to the project you created  // give the url of the original project 
4. Enable accelerate
5. Generate an accelerate connection string and copy it to your clipboard // get the url of connection pool and paste instead of db url 

step 5: install connection accelerate dependancis:
npm i @prisma/extension-accelerate

step 6: Generate Prisma client 
next, Generate prisma client that connects to your database through Prisma accelerate over HTTP.
npx prisma generate --no-engine 
here many things will be skiped that are not required at cloud side 

step 7: Deploy 
npx wrangler whoami
npm run deploy : it will deploy the worker
